# Critical CSS Widget [DEPRECATED]

**This widget is deprecated and may not work in newer browsers.**

For an improved widget, see [üìê Style.Tools - Dev Tools for CSS Optimization](https://github.com/style-tools/browser-widget).

We have created a custom Critical CSS Generator based on [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) that can provide a better result than [Penthouse.js](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse). It supports multiple viewports which enables to extract pixel perfect critical CSS for a responsive design with a single click.

## About

A simple browser widget to extract Critical CSS and Full CSS from a page that can be used via the browser console.

The widget is based on a concept by Paul Kinlan, head of Chrome webdeveloper relations team.

The snippet uses a Chrome innovation called `getMatchedCSSRules` which is deprecated and will be removed in Chrome 63. The Critical CSS Widget is made cross browser using a [polyfill](https://github.com/ovaldi/getMatchedCSSRules) for `getMatchedCSSRules`.
